# Last.fm Tracker Expansion Application

**Status: Work in Progress**

The goal with this project is to build a web application that serves as a visual display of how many times a last.fm user has listened to an album in full. It will display the albums in order of how many times they have been listened to, with a border outlining the album cover to signify the number of times each track on the album has been listened to. (e.g. bronze for 1, gold for 5, purple for 20, etc.)
